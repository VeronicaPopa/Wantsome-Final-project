      description: `<strong>Missha Signature Wrinkle Fill-Up BB Cream SPF37 PA ++ </strong>
    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`

      description: `<strong>Missha Signature Wrinkle Fill-Up BB Cream SPF37 PA ++ </strong>
    effectively conceals skin imperfections, evens out the relief and fills in wrinkles for flawless coverage
    and a healthy glow. An innovative foundation that combines BB cream and a rejuvenating serum for skin
    care. Such a component as fullerene intensively moisturizes and helps to retain moisture in skin cells,
    prevents dehydration and slows down the aging process of the skin. <br>
  
    The product consists of 2 products: <br> <br>
    BB-cream (beige) - a special "Line Smoothing" complex effectively fills the depth of wrinkles and pores,
    smoothes the skin's relief and hides imperfections.<br>
    Essence (white) - contains the snake peptide Syn-Ake and neuropeptides that have the effect of Botox and
    effectively rejuvenate. <br>
  
    The peculiarity of the foundation lies in its consistency, when the product is distributed over the
    surface of the skin, it resembles a moisturizer, but the finish remains matte and velvety. Thus, the
    product perfectly copes with dryness and flaking, fills the skin cells with the necessary amount of
    moisture, regulates the secretion of the sebaceous glands and mattifies.
    The 2in1 product has a regenerating, nourishing, masking and protective effect.<br>
    The main active ingredients: <br>
    Syn-Ake snake peptide is a synthetic substance that mimics the functions of snake venom, which has long
    been known as an amazing anti-aging skincare agent. It relaxes the facial muscles, which can reduce facial
    movement and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Safe replacement for Botox.<br>
    Fullerene helps prevent aging processes, smoothes existing wrinkles and prevents the appearance of new
    ones, whitens pigmentation and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Effectively moisturizes the skin and
    maintains optimal moisture levels in the epidermal cells.<br>
    Niacinamide accelerates the process of cell renewal, reduces the number of wrinkles, moisturizes and
    tightens pores, and protects against free radicals.
    Adenosine is one of the most commonly used ingredients in the fight against age-related changes. Tightens,
    smoothes wrinkles, speeds up metabolism and prevents age-related changes.<br>
    Sweet almond oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant effect, eliminates flaking, dryness and irritation.
    Promotes smoothing of small wrinkles, smoothing the skin microrelief, improving turgor, enhancing collagen
    synthesis.<br>
    Retinol has a pronounced antioxidant potential, softens the skin, increases its elasticity, and helps to
    smooth out small wrinkles.<br>
    Jojoba oil penetrates deep into the skin, moisturizes and nourishes. Due to the high concentration of
    vitamin E, it is an excellent antioxidant - it regenerates, relieves inflammation, and normalizes the skin
    condition.
    Hydrolyzed collagen improves the general condition of the skin: it smoothes and evens it out, makes it
    firm and elastic, removes fine wrinkles and refreshes it. It has a wound healing and soothing effect,
    retains moisture in the deep layers of the skin.<br>
  
    Cosmetics with peptides are not recommended for use during pregnancy and lactation.<br>
  
    BB-cream is presented in 2 shades:<br><br>
    21 tone - light beige;<br>
    23 tone - natural beige;<br>
  
    How to use: Squeeze out the required amount of the product (usually one press on the dispenser is enough),
    mix the essence filler with the foundation. Spread the BB Cream evenly over the skin with your fingers,
    sponge or brush.`
